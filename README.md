# Computer-Vision-Mice-Tracking
An automated behavioral analysis system for pharmacological research using Computer Vision. Built with YOLOv8, Python, and OpenCV, this tool detects, tracks, and classifies mouse behaviors (walking, rearing, head-dipping) in Open Field Tests, combining deep learning with heuristic rules to streamline data collection for experimental studies.
